        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Barcelona</strong> is a city on the coast of northeastern Spain. It is the
        capital and largest city of the autonomous
        community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6
        million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province
        of
        Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the
        European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the
        Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the
        west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After
        joining
        with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be
        the
        capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main
        economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Arab domination
        by
        the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492.
        Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist
        destination.
        Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been
        designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain:
        the
        University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are
        located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences
        and expositions and also many international sport tournaments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main
        biotech
        hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for
        global city status (Beta +).
      </p>
      <p>
        Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest
        European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million
        passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the
        rest
        of Europe.

        <h3>Pre-history</h3>
        <p>
          The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early
          settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. The
          founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city
          to
          the mythological Hercules. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical
          Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his
          family
          in the 3rd century BC, but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.

        <h3>Roman Barcelona</h3>
        <p>
          In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the "Mons Taber", a
          little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the
          crossing
          of
          the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus,
          the
          political center of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2000 years.

          Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia, or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta
          Pia Barcino or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela mentions it among the
          small
          towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be
          gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a
          beautiful
          situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own
          coins; some from the era of Galba survive.
